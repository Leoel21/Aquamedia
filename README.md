## 💧 What is AquaMedia?

AquaMedia is a physical advertising platform that connects brands with real-world visibility through custom-branded bottled water.

Instead of fighting for attention online, we place brands directly into everyday environments — gyms, boutique hotels, clinics and corporate events.

High visibility. Zero intrusion. Real presence.
